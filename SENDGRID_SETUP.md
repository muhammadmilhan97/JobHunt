### Common Issues

#### 1. Emails Not Sending
- Check API key is set correctly
- Verify sender email is authenticated in SendGrid
- Check app logs for error messages

#### 2. Emails Going to Spam
- Set up domain authentication
- Ensure sender reputation is good
- Use consistent "From" addresses

#### 3. High Bounce Rate
- Validate email addresses before sending
- Clean your recipient lists regularly
- Monitor SendGrid suppressions

#### 4. Rate Limiting
- SendGrid has sending limits based on your plan
- Implement proper batching for bulk sends
- Monitor your sending volume

### Debug Mode
In development, email sending is logged to console:
```dart
if (kDebugMode) {
  print('Email sent successfully to $recipient');
}
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### High Volume Sending
- Use SendGrid's batch sending for job alerts
- Implement proper queue management
- Consider using SendGrid's Marketing Campaigns for newsletters

### Template Management
- Create reusable templates in SendGrid
- Use dynamic content for personalization
- A/B test your email templates

### Performance
- Email sending is asynchronous and doesn't block app functionality
- Failed emails are retried with exponential backoff
- Bulk operations are batched to avoid rate limits

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Set up your SendGrid account** with API key
2. **Update the configuration** with your domain and branding
